# Passive Eurorack Non-Modules

These are small PCBs for a variety of passive Eurorack "non-modules." I designed them to be under 1" in at least one dimension, so they can fit neatly under a strip of 1.25" aluminum angle (architectural angle 1/16" thick) -- which is a perfect extra row in my Halliburton cases. You could probably make a 1u panel for each of them. Or put a few of them in a single 8hp 3u panel. Or put them in a mint tin. Or whatever.

The circuits are all pretty simple, use only through-hole components, and the PCBs are all possible to fabricate single-sided by hiding some layers. Some of them circuits are based on designs by other Eurorack folks (who likely were inspired by others).
