# Passive Eurorack Non-Modules

These are small PCBs for a variety of passive Eurorack "non-modules." I designed them to be under 1" in at least one dimension, so they can fit neatly under a strip of 1.5" aluminum angle (architectural angle, 1/16" thick) — which makes for a perfect extra row in my Halliburton cases. You could probably make a 1u panel for each of them. Or put a few of them vertically behind a single 8hp 3u panel. Or put them in a mint tin. Or whatever.

The circuits are all pretty simple, use only through-hole components, and the PCBs are all essentially 1 layer¹. Some of them circuits are based on designs by other Eurorack folks (who likely were inspired by others). For examples, see [Yan's Patchpals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChDo3AJkkG8NR5XDoN58YQw), the [Doepfer A-100 DIY page](http://www.doepfer.de/DIY/a100_diy.htm), and [Synth Diy Guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTca38SJErVLsfYkrg2R9w).

¹ The traces on the boards are all on the bottom layer, but it might make sense to place some components on the bottom of the board instead of the top (in which case vias are nice to have). If you're creative with your soldering, though, you should have no problem milling these as 1-sided PCBs. At this point in life, though, I just *order* PCB prototypes instead of making them myself — in which case it's going to be 2-layers from the fab anyway.
