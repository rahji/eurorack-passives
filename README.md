# Passive Eurorack Non-Modules

These are small PCBs for a variety of passive Eurorack "non-modules." I designed them to be under 1" in at least one dimension¹, so they can fit neatly under a strip of 1.5" aluminum angle (architectural angle, .0625" thick) — which makes for a perfect extra row in my Halliburton cases.

>>Or put a few of them vertically behind a single 8hp 3u panel. 
>>>Or put them in a mint tin. 
>>>>Or whatever.

The circuits are all pretty simple, use only through-hole components, and the PCBs are all essentially 1 layer². Some of them circuits are based on designs by other Eurorack folks (who likely were inspired by others). For examples, see [Yan's Patchpals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChDo3AJkkG8NR5XDoN58YQw), the [Doepfer A-100 DIY page](http://www.doepfer.de/DIY/a100_diy.htm), and [Synth Diy Guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTca38SJErVLsfYkrg2R9w).

## Assembly and BOMs

The silkscreens don't necessarily indicate which side of the board to place to the component. You can decide which side makes the most sense for you. Obviously make sure the polarity matches what the silkscreen says though.

¹ Except for the Passive 5 Switch Diode Fuzz, which is 1.124". Sorry, but it will probably still work under the 1.5" architectural angle.

² The traces on the boards are all on the bottom layer, but practically it makes sense to have them fabricated as 2-layer boards. If you want to mill them as single-layer boards yourself, and you're willing to be creative with your soldering, you could do it.
